# Patient-Tailored-Dementia-Diagnosis-with-CNN-Based-Brain-MRI-Classification
This repository contains CNN-based models - built from scratch and via transfer learning - for automated dementia diagnosis using MRI brain scans. The models aim to support clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in early detection, dementia subtype classification, and personalized treatment planning.
